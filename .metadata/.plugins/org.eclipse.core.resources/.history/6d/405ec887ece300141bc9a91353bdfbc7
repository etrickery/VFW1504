			{"model": "Charger", "description": "The Charger has been around in some form since 1964, and was featured as the bright orange 'General Lee' on television's 'The Dukes of Hazzard'. Currently a four door Charger with a 'Pentastar' V6 engine can achieve over 34MPG on the highway."},

Travis Pastrana drove a Dart in his win at New Hampshire in 2012 during his stint as a driver for Dodge in the Global RallyCross series. Of course, this racing version had over 600 horsepower and a six-speed transmission mated to an all-wheel-drive system."},
			{"model": "Durango", "description": "The new Durango is a large family sport-utility vehicle that has been discontinued. Fiat's plans are to focus each brand on a segment, with Jeep's Grand Cherokee taking the place of the Durango for good next year. Dodge will retain the badge, for likely later use in a cross-over."},
			{"model": "Grand Caravan", "description": "Along with the Durango, the Grand Caravan is due to be discontinued. A staple in drive-ways across the globe, the Grand Caravan has and currently is one of the best selling vehicles of all time. The first minivan sported the badge, and the Grand Caravan will be outlived by Chrysler's Town & Country after 2015."},
